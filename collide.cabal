version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Collision detection
description:
  Simple collision detection library designed to be as polymorphic as I could
  possibly make it. Designed around Edward Kmett's
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/linear linear> package but it should be
  possible to use it with other vector packages by defining the right class
  instances.
